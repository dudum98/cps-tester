    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: November 23, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> CPS Tester does not collect personal data on a server. This tool runs entirely in your browser. The only data stored is optional high-score data saved locally in your browser's <code>localStorage</code> so you can see your scores between visits.</p>

    <p><strong>What we store:</strong> High score numbers (CPS values) are stored in <code>localStorage</code> keyed by the selected mode. No names, emails, or IP addresses are sent to any server by default.</p>

    <p><strong>Third-party services and advertising:</strong> The site may display third-party advertising such as Google AdSense. Third-party providers may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to serve and measure ads. These providers have their own privacy policies and may collect non-identifying information about your device and activity on the site.</p>

    <p><strong>Cookies and tracking:</strong> In addition to the browser <code>localStorage</code> used for high scores, third-party advertising may set cookies or similar identifiers to serve relevant ads or measure ad performance. If you prefer not to be tracked by advertisers, review your browser settings and the privacy controls provided by the ad networks (for example, Google's ad settings).</p>

    <p><strong>Contact:</strong> If you have privacy questions, contact the site owner at <em>replace-with-your-email@example.com</em>.</p>

    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Check this page for the latest version.</p>
