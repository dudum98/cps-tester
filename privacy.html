    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: November 23, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> CPS Tester does not collect personal data on a server. This tool runs entirely in your browser. The only data stored is optional high-score data saved locally in your browser's <code>localStorage</code> so you can see your scores between visits.</p>

    <p><strong>What we store:</strong> High score numbers (CPS values) are stored in <code>localStorage</code> keyed by the selected mode. No names, emails, or IP addresses are sent to any server by default.</p>

    <p><strong>Third-party services:</strong> The site uses no analytics, advertising, or third-party trackers by default. If third-party services are added in the future, they will be disclosed here.</p>

    <p><strong>Cookies and tracking:</strong> The site does not set cookies for tracking. Browser storage is limited to <code>localStorage</code> for high scores.</p>

    <p><strong>Contact:</strong> If you have privacy questions, contact the site owner at <em>replace-with-your-email@example.com</em>.</p>

    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Check this page for the latest version.</p>
